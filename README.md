## Abstract 
Bayesian nonparametric models may induce clustering on the data.
Knowledge of the prior distribution induced on the number of clusters is thus key for prior specification
and calibration. However, evaluating this prior is infamously difficult even for moderate sample size.
We evaluate several statistical approximations to the prior distribution on the number of clusters for
Gibbs-type processes, a class including the Pitman--Yor process and the normalized generalized gamma
process.
We introduce a new approximation based on the predictive distribution of Gibbs-type process, which
compares favourably with the existing methods.
We thoroughly discuss the limitations of these various approximations by comparing them against an
exact implementation of the prior distribution of the number of clusters.
